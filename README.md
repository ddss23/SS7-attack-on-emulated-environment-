# **SS7 Attacks on Simulated Environment**
Utilized the SiGploit framework to conduct comprehensive SS7 testing, including SMS interception, phishing mail (fraud), and location tracking attacks, enhancing understanding and awareness of telecom security vulnerabilities.

# **SiGploit**
SiGploit is a comprehensive signaling security testing framework designed for Telecom Security professionals and researchers. Its primary focus is on penetration testing and exploiting vulnerabilities in signaling protocols used by mobile operators across generations. SiGploit covers various protocols, including SS7, GTP (3G), Diameter (4G), and SIP for IMS and VoLTE infrastructures. It also addresses SS7 message encapsulation into SIP-T. The framework provides recommendations for each vulnerability, offering guidance to testers and operators on steps to enhance their security posture.

# **SS7**
SiGploit begins by targeting SS7 vulnerabilities, offering messages to test scenarios such as:

A: Location Tracking <br>
B: Call and SMS Interception <br>
C: Fraud <br>

Note: To perform SS7 attacks, SS7 access is required, or testing can be done in a virtual lab using the provided server-side components for attacks.

# How to Use
SiGploit can be utilized to execute various SS7 attacks, including location tracking, phishing mail (fraud), and SMS interception. Ensure you have the necessary SS7 access or use the provided server-side components for virtual lab testing. The framework provides detailed documentation and instructions for conducting tests in each version.

Note: SiGploit is a powerful tool, and usage should adhere to ethical standards and legal regulations. Unauthorized testing on live networks is strictly prohibited.
